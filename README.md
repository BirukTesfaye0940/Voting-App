### GitHub Repository Description for Voting App Backend

**Voting App Backend**  
A robust RESTful API and WebSocket-powered backend for a real-time voting application, built with **NestJS**, **MongoDB**, and **TypeScript**. This backend enables users to create polls, join them with unique codes, add options, and cast votes, with live updates delivered via WebSockets. It features secure user authentication using **JWT**, **Passport**, and **Bcrypt**, ensuring protected access to poll management and voting actions.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Poll Management**: Create polls with customizable options, start/close voting, and track results.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Utilizes **Socket.IO** to broadcast vote updates instantly to all participants.  
- **Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with JWT-based authorization.  
- **Vote Integrity**: Prevents duplicate voting by tracking user votes per option.  
- **Data Persistence**: Stores polls, options, and user data in **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for schema management.  

**Tech Stack**:  
- **NestJS**: Modular framework for building scalable server-side applications.  
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: NoSQL database with schema validation for flexible data storage.  
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time bidirectional communication.  
- **JWT & Passport**: Authentication and authorization middleware.  
- **Bcrypt**: Password hashing for secure user credentials.  

**How It Works**:  
The backend exposes RESTful endpoints (e.g., `POST /polls`, `POST /polls/:id/vote`) for poll creation, management, and voting, secured with JWT guards. A WebSocket gateway handles real-time vote updates, ensuring all participants see changes instantly. MongoDB stores poll data, with logic to enforce rules like preventing owners from voting or participants from re-voting.

**Setup**:  
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url>`  
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`  
3. Configure MongoDB connection in `app.module.ts`.  
4. Run: `npm run start:dev`  

This backend is designed for extensibility and serves as the core for a full-stack voting application. Contributions and feedback welcome!
